# Programming-useful-info repo

This repository was created as a means to documnet useful information while learning different technologies/software languages. This is by no means the most efficent or the correct way of doing something. Rather, I created these notes so that I may reference them in the future should I forget something useful while developing my skills.




Useful information I have gathered from programming in different languages
